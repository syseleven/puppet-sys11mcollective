This is a thin wrapper around the puppetlabs-mcollective module.

The behavior is mainly driven by the three variables
 * client
 * server
 * middleware

 client and server are documented at https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-rabbitmq.
 middleware will provision a rabbitmq since this functionality is missing from upstream.



TODO:

* SSL support for middleware
* AAA & hardening for mcollective
